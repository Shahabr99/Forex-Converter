## Forex-Converter  

In this assessment, I built a currency converter that helps the users conver one currecy to another.

#### How it works
1. User fills the form:  
  Users can enter any currency in the first and second fields and in the third field they just enter an amount.
  
2. Request to server:  
  A request will be posted to the server and the server gets the required data from the endpoint.
  
3. Rendering the result:  
  The returned result will be passed to our HTML file and then users can see the amout in the new currency.
